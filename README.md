## Project Overview

### GPT4-RAG
This notebook demonstrates the fine-tuning of the GPT-4 model in a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) setup. It integrates external knowledge retrieval to enhance the model's performance in specific domains or tasks.

### Finetune-BERT
This notebook explores the fine-tuning of the BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) model for downstream NLP tasks such as text classification, sentiment analysis, or named entity recognition.
